### Comments 

* What are the best features of this code?
  * This code uses a for loop to check all player rugs to determine whether a game is over, showing that the author has a good sense of logic and a good knowledge of control.
  * The field in this method is properly named.
  * However, there is no java document in the code, which impedes the understanding of such code.
  * Meanwhile, this code is not fully functional yet.  
  * The author could use an integer to store the total sum of rugs of players, and check whether this value is zero or not.
  * In addition, Object Orientation is not good used in this code,  The author should avoid usage of direct string manipulation and think about how to choose appropriate class and method to complete this task.
